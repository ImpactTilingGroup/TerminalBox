## Getting Started

### Accessing TerminalBox

### Building TerminalBox

To build TerminalBox, download the TerminalBox source code and then unarchive the downloaded archive. Then navigate to the `src` directory and run `build.sh` if you're using macOS or Linux, or `build.ps1` if you're using Windows. Finally, enter your build configuration and let the build script finish the job for you.

### Available Commands

TerminalBox offers seven useful commands: `help`, `date`, `echo`, `open`, `touch`, `dump`, and `clear`. Now let's go over what they do and how to use them.

### Command Functionalities and Usage Examples

- **help**: The help command will provide helpful information, including clickable text that redirects to this page.
- **date**: Use the date command to view the current date in the terminal.
- **echo**: Log a custom message in the terminal. For example: `echo Hello, world!`
- **open**: Select a file to open using your operating system's file picker. The file's contents will be displayed in the code editor for modification.
- **touch**: Creates a file and generates a download link. You can specify the file's name and content. Examples: `touch Example.txt`, `touch Example2.txt ?content=Hello, world!`
- **dump**: Dumps the HTML tree, which can be optionally rooted to a specific node. Examples: `dump`, `dump input`
- **clear**: Clears the terminal output.
